<p>Learning Style Test - Auditory learner<br>
   ( learns best when information is presented in a spoken language format)<br>
   -	He studies well when:
   <ul>
     <li> In Groups</li>
     <li>	When he uses a recorder as a notepad</li>
     <li> Speaking out his mind</li>
     <li>	Constructing/listening songs </li>
     <li> Class participation</li>
   </ul>
 </p>
<p1>Career test - Investigative (they are analytical, scientific explorative thinkers</p1>

<p><b><u>Tingyu Gong : </u></p>
<p> Myers-Briggs - Architect</b><br>
   ( imaginative, ambitious and curious about everything but remain focused when performing tasks, decisive of their choices and when want privacy when they have down time.)</p>

<p>When I need to work as a team member, I don't pay special attention to this test result. I think that for me, many of the conclusions it gives are not consistent with my actual situation. This does not mean that I will I completely turn a blind eye to this. Only on this basis, there are more physical contacts with all members, and then make the final decision.</p>

<p>But one thing I need to elaborate is that compared to teamwork, I personally prefer to work independently. Of course, in the team, when encountering problems, everyone can come up with solutions, but in my opinion, each has its own advantages.</p>

<p><b><u>Yiyang Xiang : </u></p>
<p>Myers-Briggs - Commander</b><br>
   (natural-born leaders with charisma and confidence, and are  crowd drawers from their presence to join together for a common goal. Paired with a ruthless level of rationality, using their determination and sharp minds to achieve whatever end they’ve set for themselves)</p>

  (learns by reading or seeing images, they understand things that they can see and picture it in their mind.<br>
   -	He studies well when:
   <ul>
     <li> Using flashcards </li>
     <li>	Writing down keywords or ideas</li>
     <li> Draw pictures or graphs to help him explain.</li>
     <li>	Colour code things or notes.</li>
   </ul>

<p><b>IQ test - 118</b><br>
  Well, I won’t form a team with people who are very lazy and irresponsible because these people often fail to complete the tasks assigned to them and drag the progress of the entire group</p>

<p><b><u>Steven :</u></b></p>
<p><b>Myers-Briggs -  Consul </b>(Out-going, organised and social who enjoy people’s company and to be able to speak about people’s lives. They are altruistic, meaning they take responsibility to help others and do the right thing. They follow their  moral compass that's based on their experiences and culture.</p>
<p><b>Learning Style - Tactile learner</b><br>
   (learning by doing physical movements to remember)<br>
   -	He studies well when:

     <li>	Studying in short bursts</li>
   </ul>

<p><b>Big 5 Personalities: </b></p>
    <ul>

      <li> Agreeableness : 83%</li>
      <li> Neuroticism : 73%</li>
    </ul>

<p>The results wouldn't affect me as im fast at adapting to the environment, community or team and because of this i can cooperate with the team really well. When forming a good team, there needs to be good leadership so we can bring things together as a team and everyone with good communication skills. If everyone speaks, we can understand everyone’s values and allocate to roles they are good at and we can get to know everyone’s working style.</p>

<p><b><u>Jimmy Nguyen : </u></p>
<p> Myers-Briggs: Campaigner (ENFP-T)</b><br>
   I am omniverted so I like to be very social and am able to express my thoughts and ideas but at the same time, I like things that are comfortable and at times like to spend time alone to relax or get work done. Apparently I am charming (which I don't think I am at all), Independent, energetic and compassionate.</p>

<p><b>Learning style: a tactile learner</b><br>
   Hands-on learners so in order for me to learn things, I have to try the things I've been told to learn by hand. Whether I get it right or make a lot of mistakes, it will be the most efficient way for me to learn. </p>

<p><b>Big-5 personality: O-C-A-N (Openness, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, Neuroticism)</b><br>
   <ul>
      <li>Has a tendency to feel negative emotions (stress, anxiety, sadness, fear, guilt and shame), which is very true but I can bounce back off my feet and have hope. I am also am able to cooperate with others very well and put others first before myself(which is probably why I have neuroticism)</li>
      <li>A type of person in a team that cooperates with team members, to be adaptable while working in a team. When stressed he tried to keep composure and cooperate with the team on how to solve the problem and what measures we can do to have it not occur again.</li>
      <li>When forming a team, he needs to be aware of their experiences and abilities, so he can adapt and learn from them while not being a hinderance. He wants to know the level of communication of each team members so he can communicate with them better</li>
   </ul></p>
<p>The importance of understanding all of the team members different learning styles, working personalities and what they want in a team is for us to understand the similarities, traits and personalities of each member so we can work and communicate efficiently and more easily. It also helps to prevent any misunderstandings because we have an idea of what each member is and how they act and work in a team.</p>

<h3 class = "tab"> <u> Ideal Jobs : </u></h3>
<p>  Our team has 5 different ideal jobs and they are IT Security Engineer, Release Analyst, Senior/Junior Marketing Data Analyst, Cloud Architect
     and System Engineer. There are a few of this jobs that have the similar elements like IT Security Engineer and System Engineer they both have Security
     and User-Administrator but as for the other three jobs they all are concerned on the data analyzing like moving data to the cloud system or to another
     new system that needs migration. The ideal jobs aren’t really have a difference because of there’s two jobs that are IT Security Engineer and
     System Engineer similar that works on system security and system managing while two other Release Analyst and Senior/Junior Marketing Data Analyst
     that’s based on data analyzing and data moving and the last one is Cloud Architect which has a few similar work done.</tab><br></p>

<h2><u> Industry Data </u></h2>
<p> Our team members gave a brief introduction, and each of them shared their GitHub, the link to the production page, and expressed their ideal work and
    ideas for designing a product.  In this regard, we made a brief overview analysis.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Rainul</b> ：IT Security Engineer</li>
  <li><b>Thanh Nguyen</b> ：Release Analyst – Data Migration</li>
  <li><b>Tony</b> ：Cloud Architect</li>
  <li><b>Steven</b> ：Systems Engineer</li>
  <li><b>Aaron</b> ： Data Architect</li>
</ul>

<p> According to the data given by the Top IT Job file provided by the canvas (the number of posts posted), we have made an order for the ideal work of the
    team members according to the employer's demand terms:</p>

<p> First, the number one is Steven's System Engineer. According to this data, in the past few years, in Australia and New Zealand, the popularity of the profession
    has remained high, and it has always occupied the top few in the list, which is enough to highlight the current stage, which may include a long time in the future. Attract more
    people with relevant professional and technical skills and participate in this work.</p>

<p> The second and third places are Thanh and Aaron (Database Administrator & Data Architect).  It is not difficult to see that the information age of the 21st century is the data age.
    People's lives, work, and the operation of society are inseparable from data.</p>

<p> The fourth place is the Security Engineer for Rainul. Cybersecurity issues are always one of the prerequisites for us to use the Internet at this stage, although in the materials provided,
    compared with the previous members' their ideal jobs, people's attention and employer's needs are not as good as the former. However, after some discussion by our team members, we still
    think that this is a top priority. A simple example, now more and more countries in the world have entered digital trading, online trading, especially in China, and even in some first-tier
    cities, it is difficult to see the existence of banknotes. Instead, Alipay, WeChat pay, Apple pay and other payment methods... If a large amount of money, the funds enter the Internet,
    continue to circulate, operate, how to ensure the security of its use? We have to delve into network security, its trading network environment, operating platform, capital encryption and
    other professional directions.</p>

<p> The last one in the ranking is Tony's Cloud Architect, which we didn't expect. Even in some of the list data, we couldn't find the title about the cloud architecture. At this stage, the cloud
    function such as cloud storage is not perfect. After all, the starting time of the professional direction is like other education. After many years, its rising space is still very large, but my
    team believes that in the future, The cloud will become the mainstream. Not only has an amazing operating system and huge storage space, it will be more secure in use, protect users' private
    information, and perhaps there are more new features waiting for us to develop them.</p>

<p><b><u>Aaron & Thanh :</b></u></p>
<ul>
  <li> First of all, because Aaron and Thanh's idea jobs have a certain relevance, for them, SQL is definitely a must-have skill, and it is also a basic entry skill in the data industry. In the data
      provided by the canvas, it is also far ahead of other popular skills, professions, etc. (occupying the first place). Secondly, the programs used by different operating platforms are also very different.
      At this stage, you can draw up a plan to learn the operating systems that you are interested in and that are suitable for your daily use, such as iOS, Windows, Linux, Android, etc. The last key
      part is network security. Although cybersecurity may seem to belong to another job in the eyes of most people, for data architecture and analysis, data is wealth.  Data programmers must be responsible
      for their security, whether it's for analysis or to architect databases, with a range of information such as private messages and transaction details.</li>
  <li> Regarding general skills, we believe that the three logical, analytical, and computing skills are important to them. For the precise work of processing data, the logic must
      be strong, and the analysis can not be mistaken. In the face of a huge data system, the consequences of any step in the process are enormous. These three rankings rank among the top ten in the employer's needs.
      You may feel that these abilities seem to be related to business professional skills. In fact, many students who study data analysis may also engage in relevant markets after graduation. The industry of
      financial data analysis is the same.</li>
  <li> The IT-specific skills are not required: website production, graphic design, business management. In our analysis, data-related majors may not have much connection with management and
      design, and have nothing to do with website production. In the general skills that are not required, the skills of presentation, leader, and write will appear to be superfluous, because there is no suitable work
      scenario to apply to them. For data programmers, they are more  It is necessary to discuss and analyze the problem, rather than to conduct a subordinate level management like a corporate company.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><u>Steven :</b></u></p>
<ul>
  <li> Analysis of the System Engineer shows that the most important IT skills are the need to master different operating systems in depth, not only to learn that they like a single operating system,
    but also to have a comprehensive understanding of the field to discover different systems.  The difference between them, find out the outstanding parts, learn and improve. Among these different types of systems, the
    highest ranked is Windows (fourth), followed by Linux (seventh), and in recent years, users have been proliferating, and online users are more optimistic than the former. The ranking is not satisfactory, only 50+ rankings.</li>
  <li> Then analyze the general skills that need to be mastered, team work (fifth), creativity (seventh), problem solving (twelfth) and so on. The establishment of a platform or program system is a workload
    that cannot be underestimated. It is often a relatively large team. Everyone has their own division of labor. They may even be just a small module. The team needs to invest dozens of people. Or hundreds of people to solve it.
    At this time, the team members in the team must understand how to cooperate, not to fight alone. More often, several groups need to discuss and negotiate with each other. For a system platform with diversified functions, it
    must be open-minded and innovative. It cannot be said that no new elements have been added for a long time, so it will feel very bad for the user experience.</li>
  <li> Although the IT System needs a lot of knowledge and related skills, it is not all the skills that need to be mastered. Learning skills that are not used or not interested will
    increase the burden on the programmer and waste time. The IT-specific skills are not required: Mcafee, Game program, Adobe Acrobat. General skills are not required: Mentoring, Research, Detail-Oriented.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><u>Tony :</b></u></p>
<ul>
  <li> For now, the more mature company in the cloud architecture is Apple, but what is puzzling is that we can't find information about cloud technology in the data provided by the canvas.
    Therefore, we have concluded that a good programming language will be of great help if you need to deal with architecture development, and java is the best choice, compared to C++, it is no longer so cumbersome.
    There are also many different categorizations in Java. These skills are ranked in the top of the list, second only to SQL.</li>
  <li> Then look at the mastery of general skills, such as some time arrangements, the quality requirements of the task and other details, the requirements are quite a lot, detailed examples
    are: management (20th), planning (8th), Meeting Deadlines (17th place).</li>
  <li> Finally, analyze the ability of cloud technology in IT specific skills and general skills, which may not be necessary. Business Management, Business Analysis, Business Process
    (Specialized Skills). We have always disagreed with the knowledge that we will apply to business in the technical field of computer science. Obviously, they are superfluous. And some companies that communicate
    and do speech work are not likely to happen to professional technicians, such as presentation, leader, and communication.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><u>Rainul :</b></u></p>
<ul>
  <li> IT System Engineer, learning about security firewalls is an indispensable skill in this profession, but the strange thing is that such important skills, we did not find it on the employer demand list, for our own analysis, it is the importance of the IT field is ranked in the top five. In addition, professional skills such as C++ (23rd) and Software as a service (45th) are also important. By experiencing the application, the programmer has certain programming ability, view the source code of the software, and fundamentally solve the security vulnerabilities and other issues.</li>
  <li> In general skills, it is indispensable to have sufficient patience and attention and not to miss any potential safety hazard. Problem Solving (second place), Troubleshooting (sixth place), and Research (tenth place) are about finding and solving problems.</li>
  <li> In fact, for technical programmers, the skills required are not the same as those that are not required. Except for a few researchers on a special topic, a lot of knowledge is not used, but it is also a foundation, but it must be mastered. Therefore, the IT-specific skills and general skills here are not much different from those of the previous team members. IT-specific skills are not required: Business Management, Game Program, Business Process. General skills are not required: presentation, Mentoring, Leader.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><u>Consequent</b></u></p>
<ul>
  <li> After we carefully analyzed the data information provided by the canvas, we conducted another in-depth study and finally reached a conclusion. Although in some respects, the professional direction we selected, the planning of future work, did not get a better ranking in the current needs of employers, but we still choose to adhere to the goals we originally decided, all the way before. We feel that studying work is not just to cater to the market, to cater to the society, to live for life. We are more concerned with our own interests. We are full of interest in these topics. When we are doing these tasks, even if there are failures and failures, we will use our passion to overcome them.  .</li>
  <li> All of the above data rankings are derived from the comprehensive compilation of Top Generic Skills, Top IT Skills, and Top IT Job Titles provided by the canvas.</li>

<h2><u> IT Work </u></h2>
<ol>
  <font size="4"><li> <b>Data Architect</b> </li></font>
    <ul>
      <li> Data Architect is a data architecture practitioner and an information technology discipline that designs, creates, deploys, and manages an organization's data architecture.  Data architects define how data can be stored, used, integrated, managed and IT systems in different forms, as well as any application that uses or processes it. According to data management organizations, data architects expressed strategic data requirements, and introduced advanced integration design... To meet these requirements and to align with the direction of corporate strategy to develop suitable data programs.</li>
      <li> As data architects work, they must communicate with people from different groups all the time. Some of them belong to the IT professional field and discuss the accuracy of the programming language. Some of them belong to the design focus on the design colleagues, some special effects elements that need to be added, such as interface design, dynamic sound effects, etc. They also need with the marketing department or directly through the social platform to get feedback from the majority of users, fix the bugs at this stage, and understand the user's functional requirements, and make appropriate modifications.</li>
      <li> According to most of the videos viewed, most of the data architect's work is just an ordinary office. The desk is full of all kinds of documents, including planning books, market feedback, current bugs, new features to join, and more. In some cases, they must also go to the computer room to personally check the data system and maintain it regularly to ensure the normal operation of the entire machine and system.</li>
      <li> From the feedback of the respondents in the video, they are more likely to have some headaches for the modification requests made by some users or design managers. Some strange features are proposed and hope to join the data system. Keeping it up and running is very difficult for data architects. They must be very clear about this requirement, and do enough homework to understand that if it is achieved through technical means, the pressure is often enormous.<br><br></li>

  <font size="4"><li> <b>Cyber Security Engineer</b> </li></font>
  <ul>
    <li> A cyber security engineer is not only responsible for building security systems but also need to find vulnerabilities of an organization. More specifically a cyber security engineer’s work mainly covers three areas. Firstly, they need to engineer and monitor security measures for the IT systems, then they are also responsible for giving advice on what systems their company should adopt in order to keep them in secure. Finally, they design the systems and implement them throughout a business. </li>
    <li> Most company’s employees are the people that cyber security engineers interact with most, considering they have the biggest potential to bring the virus or malware to the company by using the USB devices, social networks or downloading unsafe files through the internet, and what cyber security engineers need to do is prevent the employees from bringing the virus to the company by raising their awareness of identifying various. Beside the employees, cyber security engineers sometimes need to work together to finish a project or fix the attacks from the various or malware. Apart from that they also need to have interactions with their bosses at some big dissection-making situations.</li>
    <li> In one word, protecting the company from attack is the primary responsibility for cyber security engineers, so they need to spend most of their time to find the potential threats and come up with a solution to fix it. What’s more, they need to be on call in case a threat or attack happened.</li>
    <li> Cyber security engineer is a highly-skill-required job, so having the hard skills is the biggest challenge for this job, according to Helen Oswell, a cyber security engineer working in 6point6, “You need hard skills to get ahead in this industry”. A cyber security engineer needs to master multiple coding languages (Java, Python Net, C++, bash, and Power shell), having a deep understanding of cyber security methodologies and a solid understanding of the OSI model, renowned ports, and services. In addition to mastering hard skills, another big challenge that a cyber security engineer is facing is working under pressure. Working overtime is a common situation for them. <br><br></li>

    <font size="4"><li> <b> Cloud Architect </b> </li></font>
    <ul>
      <li> Generally speaking, cloud architects are responsible for managing the cloud computing architecture, and their role in their organizations are increasingly important as cloud technologies are more and more important. In the videos, Gartner indicates three main primary responsibilities for a cloud architect: promoting the use of cloud technologies, developing and coordinating cloud architecture, finally, planning a cloud strategy and coordinating the adaptation process.</li>
      <li> A cloud architect needs to have experience in a consultant role. Considering they need to build relationships with customers and most of the times they need to work as a group. Therefore, they need to have the ability to work with the team and be able to express their thoughts clearly. According to Steven, a cloud architect, one of his primary responsibilities is talking to the stakeholders who are generally his customers and partners to understand how their business operates thereby helping them save money, becoming more efficient or simplify some of the complexities they are experiencing within their business.</li>
      <li> In an ideal day, Steven would probably check the monitoring tools, to see if there are any systems that are down, then he would start to work with different teams including product development teams where most of them are non-technical people who are responsible for business side. So a cloud architect not only needs to understand the technology aspects but also business aspects. It’s hard to tell what does Steven spend most of their time, as his works are very dependent. If the systems are all going well he may spend most time brainstorm the new project otherwise he may need to spend all day to fix the problematic systems. But, needless to say that cloud architects are required to be highly skilled technically, it’s already a big challenge for most people, the more challenging part is that they are also required to have sophisticated social skills as the soft skills are equally important. <br><br></li>

      <ul>
        <li> Data  engineer is a very broad term, generally speaking, what they do is helping their organizations to get value out of data. It can be build and maintain data ingestion pipelines, or it can be optimize database queries and anything in between. For example, Lex, a data engineer whose is currently specialty in developing and managing the lifecycle of Machine Learning products. That includes collecting and preparing training datasets, training and evaluating models and deploying and monitoring the performance of models in production.</li>
        <li> Normally, Lex ‘s day starts with syncing with the team, making sure they are on the same page, and every team member needs to know what part they are responsible for. And then he usually spends a large part of the day pairing with other developers and sometimes just coding solo. Apart from the coding part, he also spend few hours on non-coding tasks including  working on architectural diagrams or presenting to stakeholders. Beside the team member data engineer also need to deal with the customers to know their needs. According to Paul Lavery, a data engineer at ContentSquare, ‘ a data engineer must build an architecture that meets the needs of its users’. In his case, his job is empowering companies and helps them understand how visitors interact on their websites and apps by analyzing the user experience.</li>
        <li> As for the challenge parts for this job, Lex says “dealing with interruption is always a really tough one ” considering this job requires tons of focus, however, Lex complains that some unpredictable interruptions always happen, especially for the senior members of the team. Another challenge that data engineers are facing is massive workload. According to Lavery, they need to collect data from 70 million web pages per day. <br><br></li>

        <li>System engineer is also a very broad term like the data engineer, they may encounter a wide array of responsibilities depending on the type of career they pursue. For example, there are information technology systems engineers, systems Engineers for Data Center Networking Organization and software Systems Engineers etc. However,  in general, system engineers are responsible for monitoring the performance of systems and continually assessing all stages of operations  to ensure that problems are solved.</li>
        <li>A system engineer will often collaborate with a project manager and the engineering team as they need to take the lead to translate between the two to facilitate the achievement of a successful system. As the video shows, Juile Byrd, a senior system engineer in Cedar Rapids, lowa, currently she is on the TCTS || program for the U.S. Navy. This program is aimed to create a new system to train all their fighter pilots. In order to build a train system suitable for the Navy, Juile and her team will hold a meeting regularly where they can present the problem and show their understandings in terms of solving the problems.</li>
        <li>According to Steven Smith, a system engineer at Honeywell Aerospace, “our job is never finished, we need to always be ready for changes ready for a better product”. That means they are required to ensure that they are in their best condition all the time. And that is very challenging and energy-consuming. Smith says that his job is to understand  what pilots are actually asking for so and make that product become more than what they anticipated. So improve the product and constantly upgrade it to the next level is the answer in terms of what he spends most of his time. </li>

<h2><u> IT Technologies </u></h2>
<ol>
  <font size="4"><li> <b> Cloud, Services and Servers </b> </li></font>
  <p> Cloud computing in simple terms is a network of computers and servers that are connected like an array and behave as one computing system.<br>There are 3 different categories of services: </p>
  <img src="image/cloud.jpg" align="right" style = "height:300px;width:500px;">
  <ul>
    <li> <b>IaaS(Infrastructure-as-a-Service)</b> - it provides users with computing capacity via a server or many servers with storage. The customers are usually companies with IT expertise or recently, researchers. They need large amounts of computing power without the high cost, set-up, and maintenance of on-site servers.</li>
    <li> <b>PaaS(Platform-as-a-Service)</b> - it supports writing software for computer systems, allowing businesses to write software for existing applications or develop customer application.</li>
    <li> <b>SAAS(Software-as-a-Service)</b> - it provides software to businesses, this part of the Cloud is the largest and most developed. It is either one or a cluster of programs that are available within the Cloud and not a user’s hard drive.</li>
  </ul>
  <p> Cloud computing was first introduced in 1963 when DARPA requested MIT to create a model which allows a computer to be used by two or more people simultaneously. At the time, this was when computers were using magnetic tapes as memory. Then in 1969, a man named Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider helped develop a ‘primitive’ version of the internet and promoted the idea of connecting people from computer to computer which allows access to information from anywhere. Virtualization was introduced in the 1970s, it is a virtual machine which acts like a real computer with an operational OS. which lead to the development of the modern cloud computing infrastructure.</p>
  <p> Cloud computing in the early 2000s began to get more complex as more businesses such as Amazon were starting to gain <br> a better understanding of its capabilities. As they began to use the infrastructure model, later on, other organizations followed on.</p>
  <p> Amazon then launched “Amazon web services which offer online services to other websites and users, which includes cloud-based storage, computation, and AI. They also allowed users to rent virtual computers and allow them to use their own programs.</p>
  <p> Today cloud computing is diverse, convenient, flexible and is everywhere. It changes everything about how we approach different needs, actions and processes that were once done via analog or from our own premises.</p>
  <p> Examples of cloud computing today include: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> <b>Cloud storage services (Dropbox, GoogleDrive)</b> - offer varying storage spaces and prices which offer data redundancy and security.</li>
    <li> <b>Cloud gaming services (Nvidia RTX servers, Vortex)</b> - allow users to play any game they offer on any device with little to low latency.</li>
    <li> <b>Audio/Video streaming services(Spotify, Netflix)</b> - contains vast archives of music, movies, and shows which allow people to view or listen to them, on-the-go and on any device that supports it.</li>
    <li> <b>Render node services(RebusFarm)</b> -  with servers that contain hundreds or thousands of CPUs and GPUs, it allows users who are in the film and photography industry to utilize power in order to render their projects. Especially for VFX and 3D modeling.</li>
    <li> <b>AI/Machine Learning(Google Cloud Machine Learning Engine)</b> - it lets developers and data scientists build and run advanced machine learning models and AI. Its applications are versatile, to identify clouds in satellite imaging, food safety, and prediction-based tasks.</li>
    <li> <b>Large-scale science experiments/research(Hadron Collider)</b> - allows scientists and researchers to store large amounts of data and use computer processing to analyze petabytes of data. It’s also used as render nodes to 3D model and analyse particle collisions and particle energy analysis.</li>
  </ul>
  <p> Again, these are just some of the uses of cloud computing today that many businesses, researchers and computer/software engineers that break down and innovate ways of using this platform.</p>

  <p> <b> --> What is the likely impact?</b></p>
  <p> The biggest impact that cloud computing in the industry is data storage and cybersecurity, as more industries are leaning towards the cloud as their main source of storage, it emphasizes the need for high-level security to protect against theft.<br>There are also some benefits of storing their data on cloud-based computing:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> <b>Cost</b> - there is no longer a requirement for businesses to build servers on their premises, building, updating and maintaining servers costs are very high and most companies don’t want to invest in that amount unless it’s needed.</li>
    <li> <b>Scalability</b> - for small businesses, they may not have the real estate or money to get a server or they may feel that investing one that may overscale their needs. With cloud-based storage, they only need to pay for what they need and are able to scale up or down over time.</li>
    <li> <b>Mobility</b> - with an internet connection, a person or employee has access to all of their data from any device they possess, that includes PC’s, laptops, smartphones and tablets. It also gives employees the ability to work from home as they have access to their work via the cloud.</li>
    <li> <b>Recovery</b> - Companies no longer need to worry about spending more for data redundancy in case a disaster or incident occurs, their data is kept by multiple servers internationally.</li>
  </ul>
  <p> The main problem is whether companies have complete control over their data as third party vendors handle data that may be important to a company or are considered sensitive. It changes how people can open their own businesses due to costs.</p>

  <p> <b> --> How will this affect you?</b></p>
  <p> It affects average consumers, in a way which changes how we use technology and our everyday lives. People use it every day, in the form of google docs where they need to have archives of documents that they need to work with their co-workers or team members, when businesses require drive space for their surveillance systems for their businesses or homes.</p>
  <p> The idea that an IT company needs an on-premises server to store and work on their data is slowly fading away as cloud storage companies are getting better in terms of cybersecurity and the flexibility it can give to their consumers. Having a dedicated team to install, maintain and update servers will eventually be redundant.</p>
  <p> What is concerning is the idea of whether a cyberattack may steal sensitive information of thousands of companies in one area or can cause millions of dollars in damages due to corrupted projects and data. Another concern is whether cloud storage companies have a considerable amount of power over major companies that store sensitive data and information. The idea of an employee taking information from the servers and use it as ransom may happen but no incidents haven’t occurred due to strict security protecting the servers.</p>

  <font size="4"><li> <b> Cybersecurity </b> </li></font>
  <p> <b> --> What does it do?</b></p>
  <p>Also known as information security, it refers to practices which protect the integrity, confidentiality and availability of information against data attacks, damage or unauthorised access.</p>
  <img src="image/Cybersecurity.jpg" align="right" style = "height:300px;width:500px;">
  <p> <b>Here are the common types of cybersecurity:</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li> <b>Network Security</b> - protects network traffic and invasion by controlling incoming and outgoing connections to prevent threats from entering or spreading on the network.</li>
    <li> <b>Data Loss Prevention</b> - protects against data loss and emphasises on data integrity by focusing on the location, classification and monitoring of information when its static, in use and when it's transferred. </li>
    <li> <b>Cloud Security</b> - provides protection to data based in cloud services and applications.</li>
    <li> <b>Intrusion Detection Systems</b> - used to identify potential hostile cyber activity. </li>
    <li> <b>Identity and Access Management use</b> - it uses authentication services to limit and track access of users to protect internal systems for large businesses and corporations against malicious entities.
          <br>Encryption is used to encode data to make it into another form which is not meaningful when read, making it unintelligible. It's often used during data transfer to prevent theft when the processes occurs.</li>
    <li> <b>Antivirus/Anti-malware</b> - applications which scan computer systems for known threats and learn their <br> behaviors to detect it early in the future.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Cybersecurity began with Bob Thomas when he realised that it was possible for a computer program to  move across a network and leaving a small trail. It was named ‘Creeper’ and it was designed to travel between terminals on the early internet which prints out a message. Ray Tomlinson, the creator of Email tinkered with the program and made it self-replicating which was the first computer worm. He would use that infrastructure to create ‘Reaper’, the first antivirus software which detected and chased ‘Creeper’ and deleted it.</p>
  <p>It used to be the case of espionage and infiltration where physical drives were being taken or files were taken and photographed as the early stages of cybersecurity. In 1986 a German computer hacker, Marcus Hess along with Dirk Brzezinski and Peter Carl hacked into an internet gateway in Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and used the connection to get into Arpanet(which was a primitive version of the internet at the time). They used it to hack into 400 military computers, including some in the Pentagon and intended to sell their information to the KGB. He was later caught by an astronaut named Clifford Stoll
    After that it was no longer viewed as a prank or ‘for fun’, it was now considered a developing threat for anyone with a computing system. Each decade saw an increase in network connectivity, meant that viruses were becoming more advanced, more dangerous and more sinister. That later on, began the creation of the first antivirus software.</p>
  <p>Each era of cybersecurity is categoried by the malware attacks and each attack gave development of better processes and methods to predict, detect and destroy new or mainstream malware.<br>Here are some of the most well-known attacks:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> <b>The Morris worm</b> - Robert Morris was trying to figure out the size of the internet, he created a program that infiltrated Unix terminals using a known bug on the operating system and copy itself into it. However it replicated in a such a rapid rate that it slowed down the internet, which basically shut down the internet.</li>
    <li> <b>EternalBlue</b> - due to a leak of NSA hacking tools, it was revealed that some operating system protocols have vulnerabilities in them which allowed hackers to attack it stealthy. EternalBlue exploits a protocol used for file sharing over the internet, it was later used to form the ‘WannaCry’ ransomware of 2017 which exploited unpatched computers.</li>
    <li> <b>Melissa Virus</b> - using a macro which a computer program that creates a shortcut by programing numerous key presses that can be initialised in one press. Spread by email on Microsoft Outlook and masked as an important business email, it contained a file that when downloaded, caused it to turn on a macro which attacked your computer and infect other users by sending emails on your contact list. It slowed down Outlook which cost companies $80 million.</li>
  </ul>
  <p> <b> --> What is the likely impact?</b></p>
  <p>The world relies on technology, more than ever before. As a result, digital data creation are on the rise and  protection against theft is essential. Today, businesses and governments store a great deal of that data on computers and transmit it across networks to other computers. Devices and their underlying systems have vulnerabilities. When it is exploited, it may release sensitive information about the company, which can cost them millions. In the case of a government organisation, sensitive information regarding projects and processes that can be further exploited or used maliciously.</p>
  <p>A data breach can have a range of devastating consequences for any business. It can unravel a company’s reputation through the loss of consumer and partner trust which may hurt their investors and other offers they may negotiate in the future. The loss of critical data, such as source files or intellectual property, can cost a company. A data breach can impact corporate revenues due to non-compliance with data protection regulations. It’s estimated that, on average, a data breach costs an affected organization $3.6 million. it’s essential that organizations adopt and implement a strong cybersecurity approach, or else it affects not just them, but the consumers and economics of an industry.</p>
  <p> <b> --> How will this affect you?</b></p>
  <p>Cybersecurity protects all of our technology and devices that every individual owns against malware and cyberattacks. The number of connected devices has exponentially grown  and there is a constant need to be connected, and they don’t realise that the connections may be unprotected which can lead to cyberattacks.</p>
  <p> Online messaging has made texting on a phone redundant, as it allows consumers with any device to message and not exclusively on a phone. However with the rise of bots and hidden suspicious links containing malware, cybercrimes are on the rise which include identity theft, money stolen from bank accounts and credit cards opened in their name.</p>
  <p> The main concern with cybersecurity that its difficult to keep up with the thousands of new malware constructed that spreads in creative and innovative ways, or by normal means. As new antimalware software is constantly updated, learn and predict malware and their attack patterns, so does the cost of owning a licence.</p>
  <p> Another problem is the improvement of advanced persistent threats (APTs), they are hackers who go deep into networks and maintain a connection that can't be stopped by software updates or system reboots, it can cause small-scale or large-scale attacks that may last days, weeks or months to patch up, costing companies hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>

  <font size="4"><li> <b> Machine learning </b> </li></font>
  <p> <b> --> What does it do?</b></p>
  <p>Machine learning is the process of getting computers to learn and act like what a human does, and improve their learning over time automatically by giving it data and information in the form of observations and real-world interactions. </p>
  <p>Machine learning and artificial intelligence share the same meaning but there are distinct differences:</p>
  <img src="image/ML.jpg" align="right" style = "height:300px;width:500px;">
  <ul>
    <li> <b>AI:</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li> aims to increase the chance of success when performing a task, it doesn’t worry about how accurate it <br> needs to be when performing it.</li>
      <li> To simulate natural intelligence to solve a complex problem</li>
      <li> Allows an operating \system to learn new things from data</li>
    </ul>
    <li> <b>ML:</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li> is the opposite, it’s aim is to increase the accuracy of a performed task but doesn’t worry about whether the task performed was a success.</li>
      <li> To learn from data on a certain task to maximise the performance of the machine.</li>
      <li> Allows an operating \system to learn new things from data</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p>There are many different types of machine learning algorithms that are groups as either:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Learning style algorithms (supervised & unsupervised learning)</li>
    <li> Similarity in a type of form or function (deep learning, classification, clustering)</li>
  </ul>
  <p> And all of these consist of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> <b>Representation</b> - a language which a computer understands what the algorithm is</li>
    <li> <b>Evaluation</b> - objective/scoring of their action</li>
    <li> <b>Optimisation</b></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Machine learning began in the 1800s where it came from statistics from mathematicians such as Thomas Bayes, Pierre-Simon Laplace and Adrien-Marie Legendre. Their math techniques are all fundamentals to modern machine learning. In the late 1940s, store-program computers which hold programs in the same memory used for data. It created in the University of Manchester but Maurice Wilkes from the University of Cambridge created the first stored program on a machine large enough to perform computation. Then in the 1950s, a young, british mathematician named Alan Turing began to question the idea of can machines think with his paper, ‘Computing Machinery and Intelligence’. He was attempting the idea of describing how AI could be developed and proposed the ‘imitation game’, a test which determines whether a computer was intelligent by asking a person to distinguish between computer and human typed messages.</p>
  <p>Later on Marvin Minsky and Dean Edmonds built the first artificial neural network, a computer-based simulation of how the human brain works. The SNARC learned from experiments and was used to search a maze.</p>
  <p>As technology gets better, so does the versatility of machine learning to be used in day-to-day tasks and the software we use.</p>
  <p>These include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> <b>Product recommendations</b> - when you go to a shopping website and you bought a couple of products online, they may send emails of product recommendations. You may also notice that when you return to the website that they may offer you recommendations of products on the homepage. Machine learning receives data which are your purchases and determines product that are similar that you may buy in the future.</li>
    <li> <b>Online Customer Support</b> - In most cases when you require help and you don’t want to call them on the phone, you go to a website and talk to a chatbot. when they receive queries from customers, it analyse it and extract information from the website and present it to the customer.</li>
    <li> <b>Online Searches</b> -  online search engines watches a person’s inputs, from the millions of similar searches, it assumes what a user may write. If a person clicks on the top result, it uses it again as it believes that it was a success, when its something else, it learns and delivers a better search in the future.</li>
  </ul>
  <p> <b> --> What is the likely impact?</b></p>
  <p>Recent years have shown that machine learning is vital in our everyday lives, it its used to automate different tasks and jobs in thousands of industries which are faster and more accurate than what humans can do.</p>
  <p>These include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> <b>Manufacturing</b> - Predictive maintenance and condition monitoring of machinery and products that require tight tolerances</li>
    <li> <b>Retail</b> - Upselling and cross-channel marketing of products online</li>
    <li> <b>Healthcare and life sciences</b> - Disease identification and risk satisfaction of treating a disease</li>
    <li> <b>Travel and hospitality</b> -  Dynamic pricing for different booking options</li>
    <li> <b>Financial services</b> -  Risk analytics and regulation of stocks and the market</li>
    <li> <b>Energy</b> - Energy demand and supply optimization for different estate</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Machine Learning is going to have huge effects on the economy, entire work tasks and industries can be automated and the job market will be changed forever. It also presented in  speech recognition, Amazon and Netflix recommendations and fraud detection. As machine learning improves over time, so do other technologies that use it such as robotics, artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles.</p>
  <p>The flaws of machine learning is that in order for it to improve, it needs huge amounts of information and data to adapt to different scenarios that the algorithm may not come across. It also helps it differentiate user inputs, recognition, tracking and organising items and processes. Another flaw is that it can only perform one action for each task, it cannot perform two different functions at the same time within an algorithm.</p>
  <p> <b>How will this affect you?</b></p>
  <p>Machine learning has the potential to automate a large portion of labor work that requires lifting, transport, assembly and construction. It decreases the potential harm and risk of labour workers that normally physically perform the task.</p>
  <p>In education work, computers can be programmed to determine individual study plans, specific to each student's needs and analyze test results, which drastically reduce the time teachers spend on them. A student's attendance and academic history can help determine gaps in knowledge and their percentage rate of attendance. However, it doesn’t replace teachers, professors and lecturers.</p>
  <p>In health, it is used to diagnose illnesses that have not occurred to a person which allowed preventional treatment that treat it or slow it down. It is based on age, socio-economic status, genetic history, etc. It can also differentiate different illnesses by cross-reference symptoms against a database containing millions of data and information of patient’s illnesses and conditions. Hospitals are currently using machine learning to accurately detect tumors in radiology scans and analyse different moles for skin cancer.</p>

  <font size="4"><li> <b> Autonomous vehicles </b> </li></font>
  <p> <b> --> What does it do?</b></p>
  <p>Autonomous vehicles are trucks or cars which are run without a human passenger driving the vehicle, they are not required to drive or take control of it. They use a combination of sensors, cameras, radar and software to control, navigate and drive the vehicle. Today, many modern cars and cars when they had different levels of autonomous driving software that are on the road.</p>
  <img src="image/auto.jpg" align="right" style = "height:300px;width:500px;">
  <p> There are 5 levels for cars that contain a type of self-driving feature described by researchers of the field:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> <b>Level 0</b> - All major systems of the vehicles are controlled by a human </li>
    <li> <b>Level 1</b> - Under certain conditions, the controls either the steering or the speed of the vehicle This includes cruise control or automatic braking. The driver performs all of the other critical functions and are responsible to monitor the road and take over if the system were to fail.</li>
    <li> <b>Level 2</b> - The cars offer at least two or more simultaneous automatic functions, like acceleration, steering and braking under certain conditions. But it requires a driver in order for it to be legally on the road and the vehicle can be safely operated. Tactical driving, processes and scanning for hazards are all responsibilities of the driver.</li>
      <ul>
        <li> <b>Example:</b> Tesla Autopilot </li>
      </ul>
    <li> <b>Level 3</b> - The cars can manage all of the safety and critical functions under certain conditions. However, they require a driver in order for it to be legally on the road when the autonomous vehicle can’t navigate certain scenarios.</li>
        <ul>
          <li> <b>Example:</b> Audi Traffic Jam Pilot </li>
        </ul>
    <li> <b>Level 4</b> - The car is fully-autonomous in some driving scenarios defined by factors such as road type or geographic area. For a privately-owned car, the driver may need to manage the driving factors on the urban streets but can be a passenger when it enters a highway.</li>
    <li> <b>Level 5</b> - A legal, autonomous vehicle that can operate on any road and condition a human driver can navigate. The driver or passenger only needs to put the directions of their destination.</li>
  </ul>
  <p> Autonomous vehicles first started out in 1925, Francis Houdina demonstrate to an audience of a radio-controlled car which he drove without a driver at the steering wheel. It could start the engine, shift gears and sound the horn, which almost replicates to small-scale RC cars. In the early 1990s, Dean Pomerleau and Todd Jochem created Nevlab self-driving car system and took it on numerous test runs, using a minivan. It controlled the speed and brake of the vehicle and travelled over  4000km around America.
    In 2002, DARPA announced ‘The Grand Challenge’, which offered researchers $1 million if they were able to create an autonomous vehicle that can navigate 142 miles through the Mojave Desert. However at the time, the winning car could only travel 8 miles for several hours before it caught on fire.</p>
  <p>Google began developing their own self-driving car project named Waymo, it was led by Sebastian Thrun. Within a few years, the cars have driven over 300,000 miles without one single incident occurring. In 2014, they took the big step by revealing a prototype of a car without any steering wheel, pedals, or handbrake which made it 100% autonomous</p>
  <p> <b>What is the likely impact?</b></p>
  <p>The benefits and costs of autonomous self-driving cars are still not known in terms due to self-driving car’s functions are measured as a spectrum and there just isn’t enough data for it to make a concrete answer.
    <br>There are some aspects that the technology remains to be questioned:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> <b>Safety of the passengers</b> - it’s difficult to discern the question of a person’s safety when using an autonomic vehicle one hundred percent of the time from their location to their destination. There are many variables that the vehicle needs to consider due to the endless differences of how a person drives, the laws on the road for each country and the vehicle’s state. Although it may reduce the amount of accidents on the road as software, machine learning, AI and technology make it more reactive and error-prone than human decisions and reactions, the concern is whether the infrastructure of that software is breached.</li>
    <li> <b>Equity</b> - self-driving technology could help mobilise people who have difficulty driving or are unable to drive due to mobility, age, vision or sound impairment. But it may also change the industry of taxi or person transport as it may displace millions of driver jobs worldwide and major companies to either invest in the autonomic vehicles or may lead to bankruptcy.</li>
  </ul>
  <p> <b> --> How will this affect you?</b></p>
  <p>There are no level 5 self-driving vehicles on the urban roads and streets, it is still currently under research and development. Although all modern cars from the early 2000s and now have some form of self-driving function, whether it be cruise control to help drivers with fatigue physically and mentally or Tesla auto-pilot which is slowly reaching towards fully-autonomous driving.</p>
  <p>It also may change the taxi, personal driving and logistics industry, as autonomous vehicles replaces drivers that drive from location to location. It can cause an upwave of unemployment drivers due to major companies may be inclined to invest in the technology as a way to save costs and money from employment in the long-term. It also decreases the length of travel for logistics and delivery, autonomous vehicles are able to drive to their destination without stopping unlike human drivers that need to take breaks as it is physically and mentally fatiguing work.</p>
  <p>The big concern for today’s self-driving cars is to demystify the idea of that they are fully autonomous, as they do not realise the levels of autonomous vehicles and what they’re capable of, which is a big concern for their safety. Drivers divert their attention and leave the vehicle run itself, once the environment and scenario changes, it is unable to react to it as it’s not programmed.</p>

<h2><u> Project Ideas: (Visual AID) </u></h2>
<p>Before we can come to the question of solving a problem, first we have to relay the question of what the issue actually addresses, and how it should be integrated into our product.
   Since our solution involves around the idea of conversion of an image into electrical signals, looking into the eyes, we can definitely say our problem is much like the solution itself.</p>

<p><b>Retina:</b><br>
   In simpler terms, the part of our eye that translates an image into electrical signals is the retina. Retina however can be divided into two main photoreceptors namely Rods and Cones. These are both cell types which are both light sensitive and are used for two varied purposes, rods are for monochrome vision in the dark, and cones for detection of high details in presence of light. When light strikes either type of cells, it is converted into electrical signals.</p>
   <p>Now comes the question of details. Human eyes have approximately six million cones. These cones are of three types: Blue, Green and Red. Colours that we see today from black to white and everything in between are caused as a result of these three types of receptors. For example, the colour yellow results from green and red cones being stimulated while the blue cones receive no stimulation. The brain interprets these signals into the colours that we see.</p>
   <p>In essence, what we can gather from this is that the image that has been captured has to be converted into these three main distinct signals so that our brain may convert the signals into our desired images. Whilst there must also be a way to control the brightness much like our eyes that is done by adjusting the amount of light entering into the external input of our visual aid capturing the pictures.</p>

<p><b>Eye contraption, i.e. Camera:</b><br>
   When dealing with our brain, it would not be wise to simply use any camera to take an image, this obviously has to be done by a much intricate method, similar to our own eyes. Before the light hits our retina, it has to go through different phases, each phase focuses the light even further until the light reaches the retina.</p>

<p><b>Cornea:</b><br>
   The first stage that enables our eyes to receive light is the cornea. It is the transparent structure found at the very front of our eyes that helps focus most of the light much like the lens of a camera. Behind the cornea is an iris, a coloured ring-shaped membrane with an adjustable circular aperture which expands and contracts regulating the amount of light entering the eye.</p>
  <p>While much of this is more or less like a camera, the challenge itself is the sending and receiving of signals from the brain in order to control the iris like structure within the contraption to give a more or less seamless feeling for our users so that no extra stress falls upon them while using our product. Unlike eyes of dogs, human eyes are much more acute with focusing, hence we can read. While for dogs, they would see the whole page at once, for humans, we are more accustomed to see certain parts of it which enables us to read. Any visual aid that fails to address this inherent quality of human eyes would more likely cause needless stress in human brain, forcing it to grow accustomed to its new set of eyes. This may lead to undesirable changes in the human brain, and may even cause damage if not handled properly.</p>
  <p>From this we can deduce that the problem does not only require us to send image in the form of signals to our brain, it also requires us to be able to read signals sent from the brain so we can control our contraption without the help of any manual interactions. This is further proved by the idea that our eyes move around 180 degrees which also has to be integrated into the visual aid without any manual inputs.</p>
  <p>While this can be seen within similar products like artificial hands or legs, much of those are done by reading muscle movements sensing patterns and reacting accordingly. The similar cannot be done unfortunately when it comes to our eyes since the muscle movements cannot be determined yet, without integrating our product within the user’s eye sockets which may come as a discomfort to our user and has to be upgraded rigorously before implementing such an idea.</p>
<p>Thus as limitations presents us, the primary hurdle is to be able to read the signals and send them back accordingly which takes us to our next problem, how do we send and receive a signal that is accessible to our brain and easily readable to both ends. To do such, first we need to measure and quantify the definite range that is viable.</p>

<p><b>Field Potential:</b><br>
   The neural activity going on in an entire part of a brain is the field potential. Although not as accurate, the feedback and reading is needed to achieve accuracy. The more data we have, the more a signal is refined and goes through a process of verification enhancing the signal's legitimacy and thus inturns improves the reading and its accuracy which is vital considering it would be taken as an input to control our aid.</p>

<p><b>Action Potential (Spike):</b><br>
  The action potential also known as spike is a brief electrical signal that occurs in neurons, muscle, endocrine and plant cells. This is often referred to as the neuron "firing".
  Embedded within the membrane of a neuron, there is a series of protein channels that allow small charged protein and potassium ions to travel in and out in an orchestrated pattern down the length of the entire axon. This occurs by the protein channel slightly changing in shape when a certain threshold is reached, which is usually around 15 millivolts above the 70 millivolt resting state. This triggers an all-or-nothing action potential which then travels the length of the axon.</p>

<p><b>All-Or-Nothing i.e. Binary:</b><br>
  All stands for 1 and Nothing stands for 0. Since 70 millivolts is the resting state, it is safe to assume that the value would be our binary equivalent of 0 and 15 milli volts higher than that would be our 1. We can make use of this information to provide signals to our brain, as well as read the signals coming from our brain.  The method of doing it however would be complicated. Obviously, our brain is a lot more elusive and convoluted than the simple binary system, but in the core concept, it is either stimulated or it is not. The extent of stimulation will be addressed on the later stages of development.</p>

<p><b>Detecting Signals:</b><br>
   There are different ways to detect brain signals, among them the most well known non-intrusive methods are EEG and fMRI. These are both part of BCI (Brain Computer Interface). The BCI doesn't read mind accurately, but detects the smallest changes in the energy radiated by the brain. In December 2004, Jonathan Wolpaw and researchers at New York State Department of Health’s Wadsworth Center came up with a research report that demonstrated the ability to control a computer using a BCI. According to their study, the patients were asked to wear a cap that contains electrodes to capture EEG signals from the motor cortex, the part of the cerebrum responsible for movement. Artificial Intelligence helps interpret these signals sent by the brain and acts as a controller. Thus, Machine Learning or Artificial Intelligence is an important tool when it comes to developing the BCI systems.</p>

<p><b>Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):</b><br>
   CNN is a type of AI neural network based on the visual cortex. It can learn necessary features automatically by optimizing the weight parameters of each filter through the forward and backward propagation in order to minimize classification mistake. This classification can be the change of colour creating distinction in objects and then converting it into data or enhancing the signals originating from the brain and then read and enhanced in accuracy by the AI. The advantage of using this deep learning technique is that it requires minimal preprocessing as the optimal settings are learnt by the AI automatically.</p>
   <p>From this we can come to the understanding that the signals required to move the eyeball or iris must come from the motor cortex and so the receiving signals, which is our control signals for our visual aid should be taken from the motor cortex of our brain, whereas, the signals sent by our visual aid must reach our optical lobe since that part of the brain is responsible for creating images.</p>
   <p>In simple terms, we can think of it as two full loops going in full circles relaying data simultaneously without having to cross paths with each other.</p>
   <p>The optical lobe loop starting from the camera like feature within our visual aid as the external input conveying data to our optical lobe creating images while the structure fitted at the back of the head supplying that data gathered without any delay which acts as the internal output, since the output of data is inside our brain.</p>
   <p>The motor cortex loop detects signals from within the brain passing through the neural network, accessed by the AI, classified into distinct signals, converted into data and then passed on as control inputs from the camera like structure fitted at the front end close to where our eyes should be. In case of this loop, the eye like structure acts as the external output whereas the device detecting the signals of the motor cortex acts as the internal input.</p>
   <p>When we see the big picture, in essence these two loops are not true loops in their own right but rather a part of a bigger loop consisting of both motor cortex and optical lobe. The brain sends signals to control, controlled eye captures external image, image is converted into data and sent as signals back into the brain. The supply of data for both ends must be simultaneous to properly integrate our aid into the brain system.</p>

<p><b>Brain Stimulation:</b><br>
   While this process is mostly done in a controlled environment most likely by showing pictures to the participant to get a feedback from the brain which is also recorded, in our aid, this process has to be done directly to the brain by sending data converted into signals in required amount, keeping in mind this process has to be done without any intrusive method, that is no method of insertion can be done to the human body. This may prove to be a challenge, but the safety of our users is our utmost priority. It is not ideal that our users would have to go through a process of surgery to have an implant fitted to their brain. That being said, Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) and Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulation (CES) are showing promising results when it comes to non-invasive methods of inducing brain stimulation.</p>
   <p>As far as research goes, I haven't yet found any research data covering the subject of electrical stimulation directly done into the optical lobe. However, much of the electrical simulation is done to the motor cortex, meaning we have to integrate the knowledge gathered through those researchers and use that knowledge to apply it to our own product. Further research needs to be done on this prospect.</p>

<p><b>Summary of the stimulation data:</b><br>
   Mostly used as a method of therapy. Helps build strength in patients with injuries. Acts as a restoring function, reducing edema specially after stroke. Non-invasive electrodes placed on the patient’s skin, causing the targeted muscles to contract. A mild electrical current is sent to an area of the body that is receiving confused, few, or no signals from the brain after a stroke. This stimulates the body’s inner electrical system, inducing new connections to be formed in the brain and, in turn, allowing for greater control of the particular area of the body. This way of electrical stimulation works by mimicking the natural way the body exercises its muscles enabling the patient to maintain muscle tone and strength that would otherwise waste away from lack of usage. This falls under the category of Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) or Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NEMS).</p>
   <p> As briefly mentioned under "Brain Stimulation", the procedure, known as Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) which involves placing sponge-covered electrodes on the head and passing a weak electrical current between them may improve short-term memory in people with schizophrenia. This process is also used in treatment for depression and Alzheimer's-related memory loss and is widely regarded as safe. Schretlen and five Johns Hopkins colleagues targeted a brain region called the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which plays an important role in short-term or working memory and is abnormal in people with schizophrenia. Interestingly, parents, siblings and children of people with schizophrenia show some of the same abnormalities to a lesser degree. David Schretlen, Ph.D., a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, reasoned that this type of brain stimulation might ease some of the cognitive difficulties that afflict people with schizophrenia giving them a shot at a normal life.</p>
   <p> In a research done with 11 participants, five of them were adults with confirmed schizophrenia and the other six were their close relatives. Each participant received two 30-minute treatments one using a negative electrical charge, which the researchers thought might prove beneficial while and the other using a positive charge as a control. During and after each treatment, participants completed a battery of cognitive tests. On tests of verbal and visual working memory, participants performed significantly better after receiving a negative charge, and the effects were surprisingly strong.</p>
   <p>In another test, participants were given a minute to list things they could buy in a supermarket. Most people taking the test rattle off items in categories, naming fruits, vegetables, dairy products, for example, it was found that while participants did not rattle off more words, they did better at the challenging task of switching between categories after a negatively charged treatment.</p>
   <p>If the subjects performance can be enhanced by inducing electrical signals, information can also be provided into the brain through external means. This research consists of vital information needed for our visual aid to progress further. The methods used can be replicated and improved upon through extended inspection of the idea.</p>
   <p>Extensive research data needed, opening us to the idea of performing our own research as per the requirements. Feedback needs to be recorded and accessed.</p>
