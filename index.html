<h3 class = "tab"> <u> Ideal Jobs : </u></h3>
<p>  Our team has 5 different ideal jobs and they are IT Security Engineer, Release Analyst, Senior/Junior Marketing Data Analyst, Cloud Architect
     and System Engineer. There are a few of this jobs that have the similar elements like IT Security Engineer and System Engineer they both have Security
     and User-Administrator but as for the other three jobs they all are concerned on the data analyzing like moving data to the cloud system or to another
     new system that needs migration. The ideal jobs aren’t really have a difference because of there’s two jobs that are IT Security Engineer and
     System Engineer similar that works on system security and system managing while two other Release Analyst and Senior/Junior Marketing Data Analyst
     that’s based on data analyzing and data moving and the last one is Cloud Architect which has a few similar work done.</tab><br></p>

<h2 style="margin-left: 15px"><u> Industry Data </u></h2>
<p> Our team members gave a brief introduction, and each of them shared their GitHub, the link to the production page, and expressed their ideal work and
    ideas for designing a product.  In this regard, we made a brief overview analysis.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rainul ：IT Security Engineer</li>
  <li>Thanh Nguyen：Release Analyst – Data Migration</li>
  <li>Tony：Cloud Architect</li>
  <li>Steven：Systems Engineer</li>
  <li>Aaron： Data Architect</li>
</ul>

<p> According to the data given by the Top IT Job file provided by the canvas (the number of posts posted), we have made an order for the ideal work of the
    team members according to the employer's demand terms:</p>

<p> First, the number one is Steven's System Engineer. According to this data, in the past few years, in Australia and New Zealand, the popularity of the profession
    has remained high, and it has always occupied the top few in the list, which is enough to highlight the current stage, which may include a long time in the future. Attract more
    people with relevant professional and technical skills and participate in this work.</p>

<p> The second and third places are Thanh and Aaron (Database Administrator & Data Architect).  It is not difficult to see that the information age of the 21st century is the data age.
    People's lives, work, and the operation of society are inseparable from data.</p>

<p> The fourth place is the Security Engineer for Rainul. Cybersecurity issues are always one of the prerequisites for us to use the Internet at this stage, although in the materials provided,
    compared with the previous members' their ideal jobs, people's attention and employer's needs are not as good as the former. However, after some discussion by our team members, we still
    think that this is a top priority. A simple example, now more and more countries in the world have entered digital trading, online trading, especially in China, and even in some first-tier
    cities, it is difficult to see the existence of banknotes. Instead, Alipay, WeChat pay, Apple pay and other payment methods... If a large amount of money, the funds enter the Internet,
    continue to circulate, operate, how to ensure the security of its use? We have to delve into network security, its trading network environment, operating platform, capital encryption and
    other professional directions.</p>

<p> The last one in the ranking is Tony's Cloud Architect, which we didn't expect. Even in some of the list data, we couldn't find the title about the cloud architecture. At this stage, the cloud
    function such as cloud storage is not perfect. After all, the starting time of the professional direction is like other education. After many years, its rising space is still very large, but my
    team believes that in the future, The cloud will become the mainstream. Not only has an amazing operating system and huge storage space, it will be more secure in use, protect users' private
    information, and perhaps there are more new features waiting for us to develop them.</p>

<p><b><u>Aaron & Thanh:</b></u></p>
<ul>
  <li> First of all, because Aaron and Thanh's idea jobs have a certain relevance, for them, SQL is definitely a must-have skill, and it is also a basic entry skill in the data industry. In the data
      provided by the canvas, it is also far ahead of other popular skills, professions, etc. (occupying the first place). Secondly, the programs used by different operating platforms are also very different.
      At this stage, you can draw up a plan to learn the operating systems that you are interested in and that are suitable for your daily use, such as iOS, Windows, Linux, Android, etc. The last key
      part is network security. Although cybersecurity may seem to belong to another job in the eyes of most people, for data architecture and analysis, data is wealth.  Data programmers must be responsible
      for their security, whether it's for analysis or to architect databases, with a range of information such as private messages and transaction details.</li>
  <li> Regarding general skills, we believe that the three logical, analytical, and computing skills are important to them. For the precise work of processing data, the logic must
      be strong, and the analysis can not be mistaken. In the face of a huge data system, the consequences of any step in the process are enormous. These three rankings rank among the top ten in the employer's needs.
      You may feel that these abilities seem to be related to business professional skills. In fact, many students who study data analysis may also engage in relevant markets after graduation. The industry of
      financial data analysis is the same.</li>
  <li> The IT-specific skills are not required: website production, graphic design, business management. In our analysis, data-related majors may not have much connection with management and
      design, and have nothing to do with website production. In the general skills that are not required, the skills of presentation, leader, and write will appear to be superfluous, because there is no suitable work
      scenario to apply to them. For data programmers, they are more  It is necessary to discuss and analyze the problem, rather than to conduct a subordinate level management like a corporate company.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><u>Steven:</b></u></p>
<ul>
  <li> Analysis of the System Engineer shows that the most important IT skills are the need to master different operating systems in depth, not only to learn that they like a single operating system,
    but also to have a comprehensive understanding of the field to discover different systems.  The difference between them, find out the outstanding parts, learn and improve. Among these different types of systems, the
    highest ranked is Windows (fourth), followed by Linux (seventh), and in recent years, users have been proliferating, and online users are more optimistic than the former. The ranking is not satisfactory, only 50+ rankings.</li>
  <li> Then analyze the general skills that need to be mastered, team work (fifth), creativity (seventh), problem solving (twelfth) and so on. The establishment of a platform or program system is a workload
    that cannot be underestimated. It is often a relatively large team. Everyone has their own division of labor. They may even be just a small module. The team needs to invest dozens of people. Or hundreds of people to solve it.
    At this time, the team members in the team must understand how to cooperate, not to fight alone. More often, several groups need to discuss and negotiate with each other. For a system platform with diversified functions, it
    must be open-minded and innovative. It cannot be said that no new elements have been added for a long time, so it will feel very bad for the user experience.</li>
  <li> Although the IT System needs a lot of knowledge and related skills, it is not all the skills that need to be mastered. Learning skills that are not used or not interested will
    increase the burden on the programmer and waste time. The IT-specific skills are not required: Mcafee, Game program, Adobe Acrobat. General skills are not required: Mentoring, Research, Detail-Oriented.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><u>Tony:</b></u></p>
<ul>
  <li> For now, the more mature company in the cloud architecture is Apple, but what is puzzling is that we can't find information about cloud technology in the data provided by the canvas.
    Therefore, we have concluded that a good programming language will be of great help if you need to deal with architecture development, and java is the best choice, compared to C++, it is no longer so cumbersome.
    There are also many different categorizations in Java. These skills are ranked in the top of the list, second only to SQL.</li>
  <li> Then look at the mastery of general skills, such as some time arrangements, the quality requirements of the task and other details, the requirements are quite a lot, detailed examples
    are: management (20th), planning (8th), Meeting Deadlines (17th place).</li>
  <li> Finally, analyze the ability of cloud technology in IT specific skills and general skills, which may not be necessary. Business Management, Business Analysis, Business Process
    (Specialized Skills). We have always disagreed with the knowledge that we will apply to business in the technical field of computer science. Obviously, they are superfluous. And some companies that communicate
    and do speech work are not likely to happen to professional technicians, such as presentation, leader, and communication.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><u>Rainul:</b></u></p>
<ul>
  <li> IT System Engineer, learning about security firewalls is an indispensable skill in this profession, but the strange thing is that such important skills, we did not find it on the employer demand list, for our own analysis, it is the importance of the IT field is ranked in the top five. In addition, professional skills such as C++ (23rd) and Software as a service (45th) are also important. By experiencing the application, the programmer has certain programming ability, view the source code of the software, and fundamentally solve the security vulnerabilities and other issues.</li>
  <li> In general skills, it is indispensable to have sufficient patience and attention and not to miss any potential safety hazard. Problem Solving (second place), Troubleshooting (sixth place), and Research (tenth place) are about finding and solving problems.</li>
  <li> In fact, for technical programmers, the skills required are not the same as those that are not required. Except for a few researchers on a special topic, a lot of knowledge is not used, but it is also a foundation, but it must be mastered. Therefore, the IT-specific skills and general skills here are not much different from those of the previous team members. IT-specific skills are not required: Business Management, Game Program, Business Process. General skills are not required: presentation, Mentoring, Leader.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><u>Consequent</b></u></p>
<ul>
  <li> After we carefully analyzed the data information provided by the canvas, we conducted another in-depth study and finally reached a conclusion. Although in some respects, the professional direction we selected, the planning of future work, did not get a better ranking in the current needs of employers, but we still choose to adhere to the goals we originally decided, all the way before. We feel that studying work is not just to cater to the market, to cater to the society, to live for life. We are more concerned with our own interests. We are full of interest in these topics. When we are doing these tasks, even if there are failures and failures, we will use our passion to overcome them.  .</li>
  <li> All of the above data rankings are derived from the comprehensive compilation of Top Generic Skills, Top IT Skills, and Top IT Job Titles provided by the canvas.</li>

<h2 style="margin-left: 15px"><u> IT Work </u></h2>
<ol>
  <li> <b>Data Architect</b> </li>
    <ul>
      <li> Data Architect is a data architecture practitioner and an information technology discipline that designs, creates, deploys, and manages an organization's data architecture.  Data architects define how data can be stored, used, integrated, managed and IT systems in different forms, as well as any application that uses or processes it. According to data management organizations, data architects expressed strategic data requirements, and introduced advanced integration design... To meet these requirements and to align with the direction of corporate strategy to develop suitable data programs.</li>
      <li> As data architects work, they must communicate with people from different groups all the time. Some of them belong to the IT professional field and discuss the accuracy of the programming language. Some of them belong to the design focus on the design colleagues, some special effects elements that need to be added, such as interface design, dynamic sound effects, etc. They also need with the marketing department or directly through the social platform to get feedback from the majority of users, fix the bugs at this stage, and understand the user's functional requirements, and make appropriate modifications.</li>
      <li> According to most of the videos viewed, most of the data architect's work is just an ordinary office. The desk is full of all kinds of documents, including planning books, market feedback, current bugs, new features to join, and more. In some cases, they must also go to the computer room to personally check the data system and maintain it regularly to ensure the normal operation of the entire machine and system.</li>
      <li> From the feedback of the respondents in the video, they are more likely to have some headaches for the modification requests made by some users or design managers. Some strange features are proposed and hope to join the data system. Keeping it up and running is very difficult for data architects. They must be very clear about this requirement, and do enough homework to understand that if it is achieved through technical means, the pressure is often enormous.</li>

  <li> <b>Cyber Security Engineer</b> </li>
  <ul>
    <li> A cyber security engineer is not only responsible for building security systems but also need to find vulnerabilities of an organization. More specifically a cyber security engineer’s work mainly covers three areas. Firstly, they need to engineer and monitor security measures for the IT systems, then they are also responsible for giving advice on what systems their company should adopt in order to keep them in secure. Finally, they design the systems and implement them throughout a business. </li>
    <li> Most company’s employees are the people that cyber security engineers interact with most, considering they have the biggest potential to bring the virus or malware to the company by using the USB devices, social networks or downloading unsafe files through the internet, and what cyber security engineers need to do is prevent the employees from bringing the virus to the company by raising their awareness of identifying various. Beside the employees, cyber security engineers sometimes need to work together to finish a project or fix the attacks from the various or malware. Apart from that they also need to have interactions with their bosses at some big dissection-making situations.</li>
    <li> In one word, protecting the company from attack is the primary responsibility for cyber security engineers, so they need to spend most of their time to find the potential threats and come up with a solution to fix it. What’s more, they need to be on call in case a threat or attack happened.</li>
    <li> Cyber security engineer is a highly-skill-required job, so having the hard skills is the biggest challenge for this job, according to Helen Oswell, a cyber security engineer working in 6point6, “You need hard skills to get ahead in this industry”. A cyber security engineer needs to master multiple coding languages (Java, Python Net, C++, bash, and Power shell), having a deep understanding of cyber security methodologies and a solid understanding of the OSI model, renowned ports, and services. In addition to mastering hard skills, another big challenge that a cyber security engineer is facing is working under pressure. Working overtime is a common situation for them. </li>
